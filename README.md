# AccountM
This Java code implements a simple Personal Account Management System. The PersonalAccount class represents a personal account with features like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, retrieving account information, and viewing transaction history.
Here are the steps of our program:
Account Creation: The class allows you to create a personal account with an account number and account holder's name.

Deposit Funds: You can deposit funds into the account by specifying the deposit amount. The system records the deposit transaction in the transaction history.

Withdraw Funds: Funds can be withdrawn from the account as long as there are sufficient funds available. Withdrawals are also recorded in the transaction history.

Transaction History: You can view the transaction history, which includes details of all deposits and withdrawals made on the account.

Balance Inquiry: Get the current balance of the account.
